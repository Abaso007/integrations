    # Overview

    This integration provides a way for readers of your GitBook-powered documentation to subscribe to a Mailchimp Audience.

    # How it works

    Once the integration is installed, a new Mailchimp block will become available. Insert the Mailchimp block into any page in GitBook to allow users to subscribe directly to your selected Audience.

    # Configure

    Once the block has been inserted, you can configure which Audience you'd like new subscribers to be added to through the block controls.
